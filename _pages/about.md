Hi there! I am currently a second-year PhD student at [AIAI](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai), [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr Tiejun Ma](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/tiejun-ma). Before coming to AIAI, I received my master's degree from Peking University, where I was supervised by [Prof. Hui Zhang](https://econ.pku.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/ybjs/sjjxx/327512.htm). In addition, I received my bachelor's degree from Shandong University of Finance and Economics, and my major was Financial Engineering.

My current research area mainly focuses on the applications of Graph Representation Learning (GRL) on Finance. Here are some **key words** related to me:

* Statistic learning applications
* Graph representation learning
* Financial modeling
* Financial sentiment analysis (Behavioral finance)
