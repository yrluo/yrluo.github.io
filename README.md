I am Chang Luo, a second-year PhD student in the University of Edinburgh. My research interest mainly focuses on Graph Representation Learning (GRL) in finance. 

I hope I can keep learning new fancy knowledge and meeting interesting people over the academic world. I treat this as the goal of my whole life.

Cheers!
