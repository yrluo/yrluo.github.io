## Welcome to my academic page 

I am Chang Luo, a second-year PhD student in the University of Edinburgh. My research interest mainly focuses on Graph Representation Learning (GRL) in finance. 

I hope I can keep learning new fancy knowledge and meeting more and more interesting people all over the academic world. I treat this as the goal of my whole life.
Happy research, happy programming!

Cheers!
